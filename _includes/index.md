## Solo is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and host it under a custom domain name.
* 

## Examples

* This page itself is built with Solo. Try it out from [the github repo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo).
* [My personal site](http://chibicode.com) is built with Solo. It's generated from [this markdown file](https://github.com/chibicode/chibicode.com/blob/gh-pages/_includes/index.md).
* Two of my Japanese personal sites ([#1](http://j.chibicode.com/) and [#2](http://waza.chibicode.com/)) are also built with Solo.

## Usage

First, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then download Solo from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/poole/poole). Start Jekyll and you should see this page up and running.

**The main file you'll be editing is `_includes/index.md`**. This becomes the content for the main `index.html`.
